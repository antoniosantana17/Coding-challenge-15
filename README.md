This React project builds a dynamic and captivating "About Me" page to highlight the user's qualifications, experiences, abilities, and educational background. The application's design is neat and polished thanks to the use of functional components and CSS modules. While modular CSS guarantees a flexible and aesthetically pleasing layout, the PersonalInfo, Skills, Experience, and Education components provide information in a systematic fashion. Proficiency in props management, current styling approaches, and React component architecture are shown in this project.
